# **Parking Space Detection using OpenCV**  

This project detects available parking spaces in a given video feed using **computer vision techniques** in OpenCV. It processes the video frame by frame, applies **image preprocessing**, and checks each parking space for occupancy based on pixel intensity.

---

## **Features**  
âœ… Reads a **video file** and processes each frame.  
âœ… Converts frames to **grayscale** and applies **Gaussian blur** for noise reduction.  
âœ… Uses **adaptive thresholding** and **median blur** to highlight edges.  
âœ… Applies **morphological dilation** to enhance the detected parking spots.  
âœ… Checks each **predefined parking space** for vacancy based on pixel intensity.  
âœ… Displays the **number of free parking spots** in real time.

## **Installation**  

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Muhammadfakharulhasnain/OpenCV_Project_Parking_Space_Counter.git
cd OpenCV_Project_Parking_Space_Counter
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

---

## **Usage**  
1. Place your **video file** inside the `image_video/` folder and update the script if necessary.  
2. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```
3. The program will process the video and display **real-time parking availability**.  
4. Press **'1'** to exit the program.

## **How It Works**  
ðŸ”¹ **Load Parking Positions**: Reads `carparkpos` (predefined parking spot positions).  
ðŸ”¹ **Preprocessing Video Frames**:  
   - Convert to **grayscale**  
   - Apply **Gaussian blur** to smooth noise  
   - Use **adaptive thresholding** to detect edges  
   - Apply **median blur** to remove small artifacts  
   - Perform **dilation** to enhance the edges  
ðŸ”¹ **Check Parking Spaces**:  
   - Extract each **parking space** from the processed frame  
   - Count the **non-zero pixels** (white areas)  
   - If pixel count is **below 900**, mark as **free** (green), else **occupied** (red)  
ðŸ”¹ **Display Results**: Draws rectangles around parking spots and shows available spaces.  

---

## **Example Output**  
ðŸš— **Red Rectangle** = Occupied  
ðŸŸ© **Green Rectangle** = Free  
ðŸŸ¢ **Top-left counter** = Number of free spots  



## **Future Improvements**  
âœ… Improve accuracy using **deep learning models** (YOLO, CNNs).  
âœ… Implement **real-time camera** support.  
âœ… Add a **web-based dashboard** for remote monitoring.
